Welcome to MIDAS 2.0
====================================


Metagenomic Intra-Species Diversity Analysis System 2.0 (MIDAS 2.0) is an integrated pipeline
for profiling single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and gene copy number variants (CNVs)
in microbial populations. MIDAS 2.0 implements the same analyses as the original
`MIDAS <https://github.com/snayfach/MIDAS>`_, but re-engineers to addresses
the computational challenges presented by increasingly large reference genome databases


MIDAS 2.0 was developed by `Chunyu Zhao <chunyu.zhao@czbiohub.org>`_ and Boris Dimitrov
in the `Pollard Lab <https://docpollard.org/>`_ at Chan Zuckerberg Biohub.

Source code is `available on GitHub
<https://github.com/czbiohub/MIDAS2.0.git>`_.
